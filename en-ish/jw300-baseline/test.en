How can we avoid becoming lovers of ourselves ?
Paul wrote that people would be “ lovers of money . ”
Some years ago , a pioneer in Ireland spoke to a man about God .
What does the Bible say about riches and poverty ?
He wrote : “ So that I do not become satisfied and deny you and say , ‘ Who is Jehovah ? ’ ”
Jesus said : “ No one can slave for two masters ; for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will stick to the one and despise the other .
You cannot slave for God and for Riches . ”
She would say , ‘ I have the greatest boss ever ! ’
Now that I too am pioneering , we both work for the same Person , Jehovah . ”
How can we avoid becoming lovers of money ?
It means that they do not love God at all . ”
How can we avoid becoming lovers of pleasures ?

As a result , I did not dress very modestly .
But learning the truth moved me to make the needed effort to be a spiritual person .

So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are witnesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your daily life ?
He says : “ I never did anything wrong , but I was just going through the motions .
I looked spiritually strong , being at all the meetings and serving as an auxiliary pioneer a few times a year .

5 , 6 . ( a ) The Bible’s description of Timothy leads us to what conclusion about his baptism ?
( Read Colossians 1 : 9 , 10 . )

( Read 1 Peter 3 : 20 , 21 . )
Why do we not pressure anyone to get baptized ?
What questions will we consider in the next article ?
If you are a parent , you may have asked yourself : ‘ Is my child really ready to get baptized ?
The first question is , “ On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
What questions will we consider in this article ?
How can we be hospitable at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )
He writes : “ I hesitated initially because we were newly married and living in a small house .
But having students stay with us was truly a joyous experience .
As newlyweds , we were able to see how happy a couple can be when they serve Jehovah and pursue spiritual goals together . ”
Why may those who are new to your congregation need hospitality ?
( Read Luke 10 : 41 , 42 . )
One evening my wife was particularly homesick , and my efforts to help were not working .
Then , about 7 : 30 p.m . , we heard a knock on the door .
There stood a Bible student who brought us three oranges .
She had come to welcome the new missionaries .
We invited her in and gave her a glass of water .
If you feel anxious about having guests , you are not alone .
An elder in Britain admits : “ There can be a measure of nervousness in preparing for guests .
But as with anything in relation to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfaction that result far outweigh any anxiety .
I have enjoyed simply sitting down with guests over coffee and talking . ”
Another elder writes : “ Having friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instructors really put me at ease .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the traveling work , their best weeks are those spent staying with a spiritual person who may not have much materially but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This reminded me of what my mum used to say to us as children : ‘ Better a dish of vegetables where there’s love . ’ ”
( Read Proverbs 25 : 21 , 22 . )
Hosts usually prepare well for their guests ( See paragraph 20 )
The psalmist David asked : “ O Jehovah , who may be a guest in your tent ? ”
It is also important to respect local customs .
Why is it so important to “ be hospitable to one another ” ?
Do not be anxious , for I am your God .
Two brothers offer a tract to a painter on the bridge in front of Kaštilac , a fortress built in the 16th century , near the city of Split
( Read Titus 2 : 11 - 14 . )
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
The elder recalled : “ Graham had a problem with pride .
He was critical of the elders who had been involved in his disfellowshipping .
So for the next few studies , we discussed scriptures on pride and its effects .
Graham began to see himself clearly in the mirror of God’s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After acknowledging that he had been blinded by a ‘ rafter ’ of pride and that his critical attitude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word earnestly , and to make daily prayer a habit .
‘ I’ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I’ve even served as a pioneer .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Shepherd the flock of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under compulsion , but willingly before God ; not for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; not lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”

( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleasant for them ?
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
They did not berate me or criticize me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how busy they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”
People around the world are demanding more freedom .
15 Imitating Jehovah ​ — A God Who Gives Encouragement
“ If the Son sets you free , you will be truly free . ” ​ — JOHN 8 : 36 .
( Read 1 Chronicles 29 : 11 , 12 . )
To enjoy the ‘ good , ’ humankind must trust God and obey him .
If they disobey , they will be left to decide for themselves what is good . . . and what is not good . ”
Like that pilot , Adam and Eve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?
( Read Romans 7 : 21 - 25 . )
( Read Romans 8 : 1 , 2 , 20 , 21 . )

Enter into the joy of your master . ”
How did Hezekiah encourage the military chiefs and the people of Judah ?
How did Peter ‘ strengthen his brothers ’ ?
But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out ; and you , once you have returned , strengthen your brothers . ” ​ — Luke 22 : 31 , 32 .

Whom can we encourage today , and why ?
How can the elders give counsel in an encouraging way ?
Parents , are you training your children to encourage others ?
She also shared with me her own experience with the kind of test I was going through , and I felt less alone . ”
King Solomon wrote : “ A word spoken at the right time ​ — how good it is !
A cheerful glance makes the heart rejoice ; a good report invigorates the bones . ”
For you have made me rejoice , O Jehovah , because of your deeds ; because of the works of your hands I shout joyfully . ”
The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set goals .
Proverbs 21 : 5 says : “ The plans of the diligent surely lead to success . ”
The earlier you make plans by setting good goals , the sooner you will have success .
With a university degree in law , I could have earned a lot of money , but I would have had little chance of finding part - time work . ”
17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - room log cabin in a very small town called Liberty , Indiana , U.S.A .
Later , my mother gave birth to my two younger brothers and my younger sister .
DURING my school years , not much changed .
The town of Liberty was surrounded by small farms , and the basic crop was corn .
She took us to the Baptist church every Sunday .
They wanted me to make the military my career .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Congregation Book Study , a small meeting for Bible study and discussion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
I couldn’t believe how much they knew about the Bible !
Years before , when I asked my mother about Jehovah’s Witnesses , she simply said , “ Oh , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being opened !
I started pioneering the next year , in 1958 .
Gloria was a jewel then , and she is a jewel today .
Gloria and I got married in February of 1959 .
A dear brother , Simon Kraker , interviewed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accepting married couples at that time .
Most of our jobs paid three dollars a day .
Each week , Gloria did ironing for one family .
I remember one time when we stopped at a gas station .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !
Meanwhile , I started a study with the couple’s daughter and her husband .
Mother and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had dear friends in the white congregation .
The Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) , an organization that promotes racism and violence , was very active then .
In 1962 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom Ministry School at South Lansing , New York .
However , a telephone company in Pine Bluff had interviewed me for a job .
If they hired me , I would be the first black man to work for that company .
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so glad that I did not take that job !
Here is how Gloria remembers our time in Pine Bluff : “ I fell in love with the territory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the morning and then conduct Bible studies the rest of the day , sometimes until 11 o’clock at night .
While we were pioneering in Pine Bluff , we applied to become special pioneers .
Brother Leon Weaver , now the coordinator of the United States Branch Committee , was appointed to serve as a circuit overseer at the same time .
I was nervous about becoming a circuit overseer .
After I was appointed , Brother Thompson was the first district overseer I served with .
In those days , a circuit overseer received little training .
I remember saying to Gloria , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the KKK held a march in a town we were visiting in Tennessee .
The following month , we began our Bethel service .
Gloria was a jewel when I married her , and she still is
Then in 1999 , I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquillity and security . ”
Second , we must pray for God’s holy spirit .
If the house is deserving , let the peace you wish it come upon it ; but if it is not deserving , let the peace from you return upon you . ”
So I greeted her in her own tongue .
Taken by surprise , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I politely told her that I wished to see the High Commissioner .
She telephoned the official , who came out to meet me and greeted me in the local language .
After that , he carefully listened to me as I explained to him the peaceful activities of the Witnesses . ”

Read John 15 : 1 - 5 , 8 .
The preaching of the good news of God’s Kingdom .
Read Luke 8 : 5 - 8 , 11 - 15 .

The apostle Peter describes Satan the Devil as “ a roaring lion , ” and John calls him a “ serpent ” and a “ dragon . ”
With their help , we can resist our enemy .
Those who believe this lie spend their lives serving “ Riches ” rather than God .
We need to know our enemy , but we do not need to be terrified by him .
If we oppose him , he will flee from us .

That way I can direct my peers to something in the Bible or on jw.org that will help them . ”
Feet shod in readiness ( See paragraphs 9 - 11 )
What are some of Satan’s “ burning arrows ” ?
Now , though , I prepare for the meetings and try to answer two or three times .

And the brothers and sisters are so encouraging .
I always come away from the meetings knowing that Jehovah loves me . ”
