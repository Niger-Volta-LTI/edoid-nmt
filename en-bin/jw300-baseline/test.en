Why can we expect that marriage and family life will involve some trials ?
We can be sure that he wants the best for us , as he did for his servants in the past . ​ — Read Jeremiah 29 : 11 , 12 .

( Read Psalm 145 : 18 , 19 . )
“ Where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — LUKE 12 : 34 .
( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
As we do so , meditate on how you personally can deepen your love for these spiritual treasures .
Can you imagine how precious that pearl was to him ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apostle Paul describe our ministry as a “ treasure in earthen vessels ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Bethelites , pioneers , and elders .
Irene says , “ When I think of other goals I could have pursued , I can’t imagine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ treasure store ” that Jesus referred to at Matthew 13 : 52 , and how do we fill it ?
( Read Proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the rabbi asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
As you do this , you will build up “ treasure in the heavens , where no thief gets near and no moth consumes .
For where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had trouble getting along with a brother who worked with me .
Once when we were yelling at each other , two people came in and witnessed our blowup . ” ​ — CHRIS .
“ A sister with whom I often preached suddenly ended our arrangements for the ministry .
I had no idea why . ” ​ — JANET .
“ I was on a three - person phone call .
One of the others said good - bye , and I thought he was off the line .
I then said unkind things about him to the other person on the phone , but the first person had not hung up . ” ​ — MICHAEL .
“ In our congregation , two pioneers began having problems .
Their bickering was discouraging to others . ” ​ — GARY .
“ Do not become upset with one another on the way . ”
“ Plans fail when there is no consultation . ”
Michael says , “ My brother genuinely forgave me . ”
“ Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That difference may seem unimportant ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my irritation grew , I started being curt with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I deserve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began seeing my own personality flaws , and I was very disappointed in myself .
I realized that I had to adjust my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apologize for my bad attitude .
We hugged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”

How can we avoid becoming slaves of today’s commercial world ?
In this system of things , why will there always be some poor people ?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ counsel ?
How do we know that today’s commercial system was not part of God’s purpose ?
Give examples of how some are showing faithfulness in their use of unrighteous riches .
I am more generous in being forgiving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept disappointments and counsel . ”
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 13 - 15 . )
How did Abraham show that he trusted in God ?

After calling Timothy “ a fine soldier of Christ Jesus , ” Paul told him : “ No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life , in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier . ”
Jehovah blesses those who are “ rich in fine works . ”

( Read 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 . )
Every single time , the peace of God truly guarded our hearts and minds . ” ​ — Read Philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
How did Jesus show empathy when Lazarus died ?
If you are grieving , you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
( Read 1 Thessalonians 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about grief ?
Even when someone does express how he feels , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
At that moment , I don’t feel quite so alone in my grief . ”
“ Receiving a short encouraging message or an invitation to spend time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says Junia .
“ Those expressions make me feel loved and cared for . ”
“ Sometimes when sisters have come to comfort me , ” recalls Dalene , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .
They start praying , often battling to speak at first , but every time , within a few sentences , their voice gets stronger and they say the most heartfelt prayer .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strengthening . ”
“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ”
“ I expected my first wedding anniversary to be very traumatic , ” relates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
But a few brothers and sisters planned a small gathering of my closest friends so that I wouldn’t be on my own . ”
“ Often the help and companionship offered when there is no special anniversary can be very beneficial , ” explains Junia .
“ Those spontaneous moments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehovah’s loving arms around me . ”
Why are Jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
Other scriptures that many have found comforting are Psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 121 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 57 : 15 ; 66 : 13 ; Philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
See also the article “ Comfort the Bereaved , as Jesus Did ” in the November 1 , 2010 , issue of The Watchtower .
“ We don’t know what to say except that we love you .
We can’t understand exactly how you feel , but Jehovah does and will keep raising you up .
We hope that our prayers will help a little . ”
“ May Jehovah sustain you at this time of such great loss . ”
“ May you find comfort in knowing that your dear one is safe in the memory of God , who will remember every detail about him and bring him back again . ”
“ Your loved one will never have to face the last enemy , death , ever again .
In the meantime , his acts of faith live on until he stands up alive and whole in the Paradise . ”
“ While words fail to capture the pain of losing a loved one , we look forward to the time when words will fail to capture the joy of having our heavenly Father return your dear one to you . ”

“ Jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear him , in those waiting for his loyal love . ”
15 - 17 . ( a ) How might we at times feel about our trials , but how does Jehovah use his Word to help us ?
Today , Jehovah guides us with his Word , the Bible .
( Read Psalm 147 : 19 , 20 . )
What plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
YOU young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
Your Creator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”
You will be happy when you imitate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also drew close to Jehovah by studying the Scriptures .
As with any career , you need time to become skilled .
At first , I couldn’t start any Bible studies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several studies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom Hall .
For example , Jacob , from North America , writes : “ When I was seven , many of my classmates were Vietnamese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made plans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by comparing the English and Vietnamese editions of The Watchtower .
I also made friends in a nearby Vietnamese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pioneering .
Later , I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers .
This helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where I am the only elder in a Vietnamese - language group .
Many Vietnamese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have progressed to baptism . ” ​ — Compare Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I attended the Bible School for Single Brothers , I received a new pioneer assignment .
It’s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who progressed to baptism , but others have .
How may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named Kevin says : “ Ever since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time someday .
Finally , I started pioneering when I was 19 .
I supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a builder .
I learned to install roofs , windows , and doors .
Later , I spent two years with a hurricane relief team , rebuilding Kingdom Halls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .
Here in Africa , I move from one Kingdom Hall project to another every few weeks .
The plans I made as a boy have made me happy in ways I did not foresee . ”
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to operate printing presses and later to do computer programming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
He has studied human behavior since man was created .
It’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into disaster ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be struck with terror or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go . ”
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article highlights how Jehovah can do the unexpected by accomplishing things we could never imagine .
Like the farmer , we need to wait patiently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Micah ?
( Read Micah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Micah , we will be willing to wait for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
Abraham had to wait many years before his grandsons Esau and Jacob were born ( See paragraphs 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just imagine Abraham’s joy when he is resurrected back to a paradise earth .
Although you meant to harm me , God intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wait patiently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has richly rewarded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wait patiently ?
What lessons do we learn from what happened to the apostle Paul in Philippi ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
Soon after he arrived in Macedonia , he ended up in prison !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to Paul ?
Both he and Silas started “ praying and praising God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Paul’s situation change unexpectedly ?
What will we now discuss and review together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
We need to act in harmony with our prayers .
Sometimes he surprises us by doing the unexpected .
( a ) What lesson do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehovah’s actions exceeded all of Joseph’s expectations .
Think , too , about Joseph’s great - grandmother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah cares for us and wants us to succeed .
How can we strip off and keep off the old personality ?
By 1939 there were 6,000 of them in the [ concentration camps ] . ”
And you people have cleaned the stadium so nicely .
But most of all , you are truly multiracial . ”
What will be considered in this article , and why ?
But the more I had sexual relations , the more insecure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until Sakura was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wait for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could watch pornographic videos . ”
What helped Stephen to put away anger and abusive speech ?
He says : “ Our family life improved dramatically .
Today , Stephen serves as a ministerial servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for several years .
Bible texts that encouraged me were Isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had abandoned sinful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
We also benefit from God’s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
What will be discussed in the next article ?
Some of the names in this article have been changed .
See chapter 25 in the book Questions Young People Ask ​ — Answers That Work , Volume 1 .
( Read Colossians 3 : 10 - 14 . )
He stated : “ There is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , foreigner , Scythian , slave , or freeman . ”

We are so thankful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in showing mildness and patience ?
Just as Jehovah freely forgave you , you must also do the same . ”
Then he added : “ If you continue showing favoritism , you are committing sin . ”
Why is it important that we clothe ourselves with love ?
Love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get puffed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ Little children , we should love , not in word or with the tongue , but in deed and truth . ”
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I imitate Jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
After reflecting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Later , I learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
I concluded that she probably did not really mean what she wrote .
Reflecting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when provoked helped me to show similar love to my coworker . ”
By leaving heaven , “ he emptied himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
PEACE : “ Putting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the uniting bond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peaceful spirit is truly unique in today’s divided world ?
Paul wrote : “ Love builds up . ”
The following day , they had outgrown the venue . ”
Below the picture was the caption : “ Invasion of the streets . ”
One congregation wrote , “ The only line that passes near this place is a telegraph line . ”
In Mexico , 2,262,646 people attended the Memorial in 2016 .
Matthew’s account focuses on events that involved Joseph .

In what ways can parents help their children to develop self - control ?
How can you help your children to develop self - control ?
( Read Exodus 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be interested in what the Bible says about compassion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah send angels to Sodom ?
( Read Exodus 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers , warning them again and again , because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of compassion is “ to suffer together . ”
“ Be courageous and strong and go to work .
How can young ones and their parents show courage ?

( Read 2 Timothy 1 : 7 . )
Let us consider two areas of life where we need courage : in our family and in the congregation .

She writes : “ Growing up , I was really shy .
I could barely talk to people at the Kingdom Hall , much less knock on the doors of complete strangers . ”
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian achieved her goal of becoming a regular pioneer .
How can Psalm 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psalm 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents expend much effort and resources helping their children reach goals in such areas as sports , recreation , and education .
It makes so much more sense to expend effort and resources in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great source of satisfaction not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the journey with them . ”
Give examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( Read Titus 2 : 3 - 5 . )
( a ) How can baptized brothers be courageous ?
( Read Philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We urge all baptized brothers to be courageous and work hard for the congregation !
Therefore , “ be courageous . . . and go to work . ”
1 , 2 . ( a ) What would life be like without the Bible ?
The apostle Peter quoted Isaiah 40 : 8 .
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )
( a ) How do languages change over time ?
Later printings also used the word “ LORD ” in capital letters in some verses in the Christian Greek Scriptures .

What responsibility do brothers who teach from the platform have ?
Are we not grateful to Jehovah for his written Word , the Bible ?
See the box “ A Turning Point . ”
Take time to explain , illustrate , and apply verses that you read
“ A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom Hall . . . , the speaker referred to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those verses liken God’s Word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I resisted this new idea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a scripture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is quoted as saying : ‘ Come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Come on , Vicky , let’s set matters straight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was unable to sleep that night .
I still doubted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
All of a sudden , it dawned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your Son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been throwing the ransom back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”
These articles discuss Zechariah’s sixth , seventh , and eighth visions .
First , let me tell you about my background .
I WAS born in 1923 in Hemsworth , a town in Yorkshire , England .
The following year , I was appointed as a special pioneer , along with Mary Henshall .
We were sent to unassigned territory in the county of Cheshire .
It is a great joy to know that there are now many Witnesses in that area .
My brother and his wife , Lottie , were already serving as special pioneers in Northern Ireland , and in 1952 the four of us attended a district convention in Belfast .
That night the four of us slept in the car .
Amazingly , we had no problem parking the trailer on the property of friendly farmers .
We really enjoyed our assignment in the circuit work .
The first international convention in Ireland was held in Dublin in 1965 .
A total of 3,948 attended , and 65 got baptized .

But when you go through these kinds of situations , you draw closer to Jehovah .

He writes : “ I hesitated initially because we were newly married and living in a small house .

He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God’s Word earnestly , and to make daily prayer a habit .
The apostle Peter wrote : “ Shepherd the flock of God under your care , serving as overseers , not under compulsion , but willingly before God ; not for love of dishonest gain , but eagerly ; not lording it over those who are God’s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”

( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedience to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daughter was reinstated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleasant for them ?
( Read Hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
They did not berate me or criticize me , but they encouraged me and strengthened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how busy they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God’s love .
Time and time again , however , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confirm his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is crouching at the door , and its craving is to dominate you ; but will you get the mastery over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”

The apostle Paul promised : “ God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name . ”
You are never too young to set goals .

17 , 18 . ( a ) What does Jehovah want for young people today ?
I was born in a one - room log cabin in a very small town called Liberty , Indiana , U.S.A .
Later , my mother gave birth to my two younger brothers and my younger sister .
DURING my school years , not much changed .
The town of Liberty was surrounded by small farms , and the basic crop was corn .
She took us to the Baptist church every Sunday .
They wanted me to make the military my career .
This time , however , they invited me to come to a Congregation Book Study , a small meeting for Bible study and discussion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
Years before , when I asked my mother about Jehovah’s Witnesses , she simply said , “ Oh , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”

I started pioneering the next year , in 1958 .
Gloria was a jewel then , and she is a jewel today .
Gloria and I got married in February of 1959 .
A dear brother , Simon Kraker , interviewed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accepting married couples at that time .
Most of our jobs paid three dollars a day .
Each week , Gloria did ironing for one family .
I remember one time when we stopped at a gas station .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our ministry !

Mother and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had dear friends in the white congregation .
The Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) , an organization that promotes racism and violence , was very active then .
In 1962 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom Ministry School at South Lansing , New York .
However , a telephone company in Pine Bluff had interviewed me for a job .
If they hired me , I would be the first black man to work for that company .
I had no money to travel to New York .
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
I am so glad that I did not take that job !
Here is how Gloria remembers our time in Pine Bluff : “ I fell in love with the territory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the morning and then conduct Bible studies the rest of the day , sometimes until 11 o’clock at night .
While we were pioneering in Pine Bluff , we applied to become special pioneers .
Brother Leon Weaver , now the coordinator of the United States Branch Committee , was appointed to serve as a circuit overseer at the same time .
I was nervous about becoming a circuit overseer .
After I was appointed , Brother Thompson was the first district overseer I served with .
In those days , a circuit overseer received little training .
I remember saying to Gloria , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the KKK held a march in a town we were visiting in Tennessee .
The following month , we began our Bethel service .
Gloria was a jewel when I married her , and she still is
Then in 1999 , I was appointed to be a member of the Governing Body .
Isaiah 32 : 17 says : “ The result of true righteousness will be peace , and the fruitage of true righteousness will be lasting tranquillity and security . ”

So I greeted her in her own tongue .
Taken by surprise , she asked me , ‘ What is the reason for your visit ? ’
I politely told her that I wished to see the High Commissioner .
She telephoned the official , who came out to meet me and greeted me in the local language .
After that , he carefully listened to me as I explained to him the peaceful activities of the Witnesses . ”
